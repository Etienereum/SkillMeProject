Build a cryptocurrency system with an auction feature in Solidity.

Requirements:
- (DONE) Only one user can create additional coins. All users can transfer their 
coins to others at will.

- (DONE) The balance of any user's wallet cannot be negative.

- (DONE) Allow a user to start an Auction with a given bidding period.

- (DONE )The Auction can be selected to be blind or not on creation. If blind, 
then no one can see other user's bids; otherwise, all users can see all 
other users' bid.

- (DONE) For an Auction, the transfer will only be triggered if the bidding period 
ends. And only the one with the highest bid would need to transfer.
